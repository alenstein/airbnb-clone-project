## 🔐 API Security

Securing backend APIs is critical to ensure the safety, reliability, and integrity of the platform. Below are the measures taken:

### 1. Authentication

Only verified users can access protected resources using JWT or session-based authentication.

- Ensures users are who they claim to be  
- Protects accounts from unauthorized access  

> **Why it matters**: Safeguards user profiles, bookings, and listings.

---

### 2. Authorization

Access control based on user roles (guest, host, admin).

- Guests: Book and review  
- Hosts: Manage listings  
- Admins: Oversee operations  

> **Why it matters**: Prevents unauthorized actions and data tampering.

---

### 3. Rate Limiting

Controls the number of API requests per user/time window.

- Prevents brute-force attacks  
- Reduces server overload  

> **Why it matters**: Ensures fair usage and platform stability.

---

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization

Validates all user inputs.

- Prevents SQL injection and XSS  
- Ensures clean and expected input  

> **Why it matters**: Prevents system compromise via malicious inputs.

---

### 5. HTTPS Enforcement

All traffic is encrypted.

- Protects against data interception and MITM attacks  

> **Why it matters**: Secures logins, payments, and sensitive operations.

---

### 6. Secure Payment Handling

Uses third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) with tokenization.

- No sensitive data is stored on our servers  

> **Why it matters**: Ensures PCI compliance and user trust.
