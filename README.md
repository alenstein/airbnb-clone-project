- `price_per_night`

**Relationships:**
- A property belongs to one user.
- A property can have many bookings.
- A property can have multiple reviews.

---

### 3. Bookings

**Represents** reservations made by guests.

**Key Fields:**
- `id`
- `user_id` (guest)
- `property_id`
- `start_date`
- `end_date`

**Relationships:**

## 🔐 API Security

Securing backend APIs is critical to ensure the safety, reliability, and integrity of the platform. Below are the measures taken:

### 1. Authentication

Only verified users can access protected resources using JWT or session-based authentication.

- Ensures users are who they claim to be  
- Protects accounts from unauthorized access  

> **Why it matters**: Safeguards user profiles, bookings, and listings.

---

### 2. Authorization

Access control based on user roles (guest, host, admin).

- Guests: Book and review  
- Hosts: Manage listings  
- Admins: Oversee operations  

> **Why it matters**: Prevents unauthorized actions and data tampering.

---

### 3. Rate Limiting

Controls the number of API requests per user/time window.

- Prevents brute-force attacks  
- Reduces server overload  

> **Why it matters**: Ensures fair usage and platform stability.

---

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization

Validates all user inputs.

- Prevents SQL injection and XSS  
- Ensures clean and expected input  

> **Why it matters**: Prevents system compromise via malicious inputs.

---

### 5. HTTPS Enforcement

All traffic is encrypted.

- Protects against data interception and MITM attacks  

> **Why it matters**: Secures logins, payments, and sensitive operations.

---

### 6. Secure Payment Handling

Uses third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) with tokenization.

- No sensitive data is stored on our servers  

> **Why it matters**: Ensures PCI compliance and user trust.

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the software development lifecycle, enabling teams to integrate code changes frequently, run automated tests, and deploy updates efficiently. This ensures faster delivery, higher reliability, and better collaboration across the development team.

### 🚀 Importance of CI/CD in the Project

- **Improved Collaboration**: CI/CD promotes seamless cooperation between developers, QA engineers, and DevOps by establishing a unified workflow and providing immediate feedback on code changes.

- **Faster Development Cycles**: By automating build, test, and deployment processes, the team can release features and fixes quickly, adapting rapidly to user needs.

- **Consistent Quality**: Automated tests catch issues early, ensuring that only verified code is deployed to production.

- **Reliable Deployments**: The pipeline reduces the risk of human error by maintaining consistent deployment procedures across all environments.

### 🛠️ Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions**: For automating tasks such as testing, building, and deploying code on every push or pull request.
- **Docker**: To containerize the application, ensuring consistency between development, testing, and production environments.
- **Deployment Platforms**: Services like Heroku, Render, or AWS can be used to host and scale the application reliably.
